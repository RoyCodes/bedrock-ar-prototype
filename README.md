# AR Adventure Travel Packing Helper

## Overview
The goal of this prototype is to build an AR Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps users prepare for camping adventures. Use your mobile phone's camera to scan your car's trunk for advice on what gear to pack for your trip. The app calculate the volume of the trunk and use that to inform a smart checklist of items to bring, from all of the important categories, such as food, water, communication, recovery gear, shelter, clothing, etc... 

Product details, and feedback from other users can be ingested into Bedrock Data Automation for smart product recommendations.
